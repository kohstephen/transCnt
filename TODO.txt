- Ying make all geometries own their k, c, p, and a by having material be a class instead of string
- Ying make environment class that owns envmat and t_inf
DONE - Linjie implement avg temp functions
- Linjie graphs of temp vs. time
    - single point over specified time range given time sampling density
    - entire object's avg temp, min, and max temp over specified time range given time sampling density
- STEPHEN vectorized calculations for all geometries given mesh density and densities
  can have multiple dims
- STEPHEN validate vectorized calcs with MATLAB
- STEPHEN exception handling, including: 
    - user prevented from querying temperature at a point whose absolute value of 
      locations exceed the object's dimensions
    - T_inf > 0 (absolute zero is min temp)
    - T_init > 0
    - all Dims > 0
    - all Secs > 0
    - all times in seconds
- Ying functions to convert Kelvin to Fahrenheit and Celcius (easy), both scalars and temp matrices
- STEPHEN more object materials (k, c, p) 
- Ying user allowed to override h, the convection coefficient
- Ying leak checking
- ALL documentation
- ALL presentation
- Linjie Re-org files
- Linjie Makefile
- Testcases
- Performance eval
